- Update Russian translations.
- Add support for NeoForge's `ToolActions` (should improve compatibility with modded hoes).
- Add a warning message that is displayed _once_ when trying to harvest a crop without a hoe,
  where `requireHoe` is `true` in the config - this is the number one question I get in my
  Discord; 'why is RightClickHarvest not working'.
